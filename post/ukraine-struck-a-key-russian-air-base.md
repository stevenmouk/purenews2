Ukraine took responsibility for a significant strike on a key Russian air base overnight on Wednesday, igniting a fire at the facility.

On Thursday, Ukraine’s General Staff announced that its special forces had detonated an ammunition depot at Engels-2 air base in Russia’s Saratov region, triggering explosions and fires.

Engels-2, located about 450 miles from unoccupied Ukrainian territory, serves as a critical launch site for Russia’s Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers, which have carried out heavy strikes on Ukraine.

It remains unclear whether any aircraft sustained damage in the attack.

Ukraine’s military did not specify what weapons were used, but Roman Busargin, the regional governor, reported that Russian air defenses had intercepted 54 drones.

Busargin called it the most significant attack on the area since 2022. Russian authorities typically do not provide details on such strikes.

In a Telegram post on Thursday, Busargin said a state of emergency had been declared, and civilians were evacuated from areas surrounding the base.

Russian independent media outlet Astra shared videos and images showing thick plumes of smoke and reported hearing multiple explosions.

According to Busargin, the blasts shattered windows at two kindergartens, a school, and a hospital, leaving one woman injured.

Business Insider was unable to independently verify these reports.

The attack on Engels-2 was part of a broader wave of strikes, with Russia’s Ministry of Defense claiming to have downed 134 drones across six regions overnight.

This marks the third attack on Engels-2 this year.

In January, Ukraine’s 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment said it was behind what it described as its largest assault on a Russian military site, targeting an oil storage facility that supplies fuel for the bombers.

Russia has implemented various defensive measures to protect the base, including stacking tires on aircraft, seemingly to deceive Ukrainian missiles.

In 2023, Russia moved some of its bombers farther east in an attempt to shield them from Ukrainian strikes.
