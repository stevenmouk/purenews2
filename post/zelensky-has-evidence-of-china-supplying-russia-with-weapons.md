Ukraine has obtained intelligence indicating that China is providing Russia with artillery and gunpowder, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday.

“We have finally received information that China is supplying weapons to the Russian Federation,” Zelensky announced during a press conference in Kyiv.

“We believe that Chinese representatives are engaged in the production of some weapons on the territory of Russia,” he added.

Zelensky did not clarify whether he was referring to full artillery systems or simply shells.

The claim is likely to further strain already tense relations between Kyiv and Beijing. Friction has grown since Ukraine publicly revealed it had captured Chinese nationals fighting alongside Russian forces.

China has thus far tried to maintain an appearance of neutrality in the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.
