Amazon has confirmed it will contribute $1 million in cash to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund, joining other major tech companies in seeking to strengthen ties with the president-elect. This follows a similar $1 million donation by Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, Amazon plans to stream Trump’s inauguration on its Prime Video platform.

Big Tech companies are navigating a delicate relationship with Trump, who has frequently accused them of censorship against conservative voices. After his recent election victory, executives from major firms like Google, Apple, and Meta were quick to extend congratulations, contrasting with their more measured approach during his previous term. These gestures come as the industry seeks relief from ongoing scrutiny over antitrust issues, corporate mergers, and artificial intelligence advancements.

Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chair and founder, is reportedly planning a visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet Trump there, while Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg had already dined with the president-elect shortly after his win.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also emerged as a close ally of Trump, having donated tens of millions to his campaign. Musk has been tapped by Trump to lead a team focused on reforming government operations. Apple, on the other hand, faces potential challenges under Trump’s proposed tariffs, which could disrupt its critical supply chains in China. During Trump’s first term, Apple CEO Tim Cook managed to negotiate exemptions for the company’s products.

Amazon’s relationship with Trump has been contentious in the past. During his first term, Trump accused the e-commerce giant of undercutting businesses and avoiding taxes. In 2018, he ordered a review of the U.S. Postal Service’s pricing for package deliveries, accusing it of serving as Amazon’s "delivery boy."

The Biden administration has also ramped up pressure on Amazon. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), led by Lina Khan, along with several states, filed a landmark antitrust lawsuit against the company. The FTC is also investigating major cloud providers, including Amazon, over their partnerships in generative AI technologies.

Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, has had a complicated public relationship with Trump. After a failed assassination attempt on Trump earlier this year, Bezos praised the president-elect for his "grace and courage under literal fire" in a post on X. Bezos also barred The Washington Post from endorsing Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in October, denying allegations that the decision was linked to potential benefits for his space venture, Blue Origin, which competes with Elon Musk’s SpaceX.
