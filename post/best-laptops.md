## 1) The Best Overall Laptop: Dell Precision 5690, $2,799

<br/>

Pros: Gorgeous 4K OLED touch display, impressive performance for its size, sleek and durable design, responsive keyboard, excellent battery life for a workstation

Cons: No USB-A ports or webcam shutter, limited expandability, very expensive

The Dell Precision 5690 reclaims its spot at the top of the mobile workstation market with a powerful combination of Intel Core Ultra processors and Nvidia RTX Ada graphics. Despite being just 0.87 inches thick, it delivers outstanding performance suitable for demanding tasks like 3D design, rendering, and engineering. The laptop features a vivid 16-inch OLED touchscreen with a sharp 3840x2400 resolution, 400-nit brightness, and professional-grade color calibration tools. Its aluminum and reinforced polycarbonate chassis not only looks and feels premium but also meets several MIL-STD 810H durability standards.

While the keyboard is snappy and comfortable for fast typing, the design does miss a few practical features like a numeric keypad and USB-A ports. Performance-wise, the Precision 5690 can be configured with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor, Nvidia RTX 5000 Ada GPU, 64GB of RAM, and dual SSDs—making it a true powerhouse. Battery life is another highlight, offering nearly double the runtime of many competing Windows workstations, though heavy workloads will still require a power source nearby.

At a price that can top $6,500 for this kind of power, the Precision 5690 while not cheap either, is built for professionals who demand reliability and speed in a mobile form factor. It's especially well-suited for users who travel frequently or present work to clients, offering portability without sacrificing capability. Whether you're an engineer, creative professional, or designer, this machine delivers elite-level performance in a refined, road-ready package.

Pros: Lower starting price, faster M4 chip, base model now includes 16GB RAM, upgraded 12MP Center Stage webcam, quiet fanless design

Cons: Slight dip in battery life from last year, still limited to two Thunderbolt ports, LCD display feels dated next to OLED, some Windows laptops outperform it

Apple’s 2025 MacBook Air continues to be the default recommendation for most users, and this year’s model offers even better value. With a price drop bringing it back under $1,000 and a new M4 processor delivering more speed and AI-ready performance, this update strengthens an already excellent machine. The Air now also features the same improved 12MP Center Stage webcam as the MacBook Pro, making it a better option for video calls. While much of the laptop remains unchanged—including its razor-thin 0.44-inch profile, lightweight 2.7-pound chassis, and premium keyboard and trackpad—its core strengths are enough to keep it on top of the ultraportable market.

The display, a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina panel with 2560 x 1664 resolution, remains crisp and vibrant with support for True Tone and wide color gamuts (100% sRGB and 95% DCI-P3). However, the tech is starting to show its age compared to OLED competitors. Performance-wise, the M4 chip brings solid gains in speed and enables second-gen ray tracing support for games and creative tools. While it’s not a replacement for the MacBook Pro in serious content creation, the Air is more than capable for everyday productivity, media work, and light rendering.

Battery life, though slightly reduced from last year, still approaches 20 hours in tests—enough to power through long workdays or study sessions. And with the base model now starting at 16GB of RAM, Apple has made it easier to choose upgrades without needing a big jump in price.

This model is ideal for longtime Apple users who want seamless integration with devices like the iPhone or iPad—especially now that macOS Sequoia includes full iPhone Mirroring. It's also a great fit for students, thanks to its reliability, durable build, and popularity in creative and liberal arts fields. Whether you're already in the Apple ecosystem or just want a dependable, stylish ultraportable, the 2025 MacBook Air remains a smart, balanced choice.

<br/>

Pros: Smooth everyday performance, long battery life, current Wi-Fi connectivity, budget-friendly price

Cons: Outdated design, underwhelming display, limited performance ceiling, top-tier models get outclassed

The Acer Aspire 3 proves that a budget laptop doesn’t have to feel like a compromise. While it won’t wow you with style or speed, it delivers solid day-to-day functionality at a price that’s hard to beat. Starting at $500—and often found for even less—this 15-inch notebook is ideal for users who just need the basics done right. It offers smooth performance for simple tasks like web browsing, streaming, and document editing, along with a surprisingly comfortable keyboard and included numeric keypad—features that help it punch above its price tag.

The design is no-frills and leans toward the dated side, with a plastic chassis that feels a bit light and minimalistic. Still, it’s practical, with rubber bottom pads to keep it steady and a typing experience that’s fast and accurate. The display is also serviceable: a 1080p resolution panel with anti-glare coating that makes it usable in bright lighting. Just don’t expect rich color or high brightness, as it doesn’t cover full color gamuts and looks bland compared to more premium screens.

Performance is enough for everyday use, but this isn’t a machine for multitasking power users or creative workloads. You’ll be fine using it for school, browsing, or office work, but it’s not built for gaming or intensive editing. Battery life is where the Aspire 3 shines—it outlasted every other laptop in its category with nearly 17 hours of runtime in testing, making it a standout for all-day reliability. That kind of longevity, combined with modern Wi-Fi connectivity and solid efficiency, adds serious value.

Ultimately, the Aspire 3 is best suited for budget-conscious buyers and first-time users. If you're shopping for a reliable laptop for your child or need a low-cost, long-lasting option for light computing, this model delivers. It’s not built for power, but it is built for lasting usefulness, and that makes it one of the best low-cost laptops you can buy today.

Pros: Sleek and lightweight, competitively priced, stunning 2.8K OLED touchscreen, impressive audio

Cons: Middling keyboard, lacks USB-A and card slots, no mobile broadband option

Lenovo’s ThinkPad X9 14 is a stylish attempt at crafting the ultimate ultraportable, blending premium design with practical business features. While it may not beat competitors on raw power or price-to-performance ratio, it holds its own in design and portability—standing as a serious Windows alternative to the MacBook Air. Built from partially recycled aluminum, the chassis is incredibly slim at just 0.51 inches and weighs only 2.74 pounds. A subtle wedge at the bottom cleverly houses the ports and makes space for fan cooling—something rare in machines this thin and useful for sustained performance under heavier loads.

The real standout feature is its 14-inch 2.8K OLED touchscreen. Vibrant, ultra-sharp, and bright at 505 nits, it delivers rich visuals and supports a 120Hz refresh rate that dynamically adjusts based on the content. It also covers 98% of Adobe RGB, placing it just shy of perfect color accuracy. If you're coming from a high-end phone display, this laptop will feel instantly familiar and premium.

Performance is driven by Intel’s Core Ultra 200V chip, which favors efficiency over brute force. While it won’t compete with beefier setups, it handles everyday tasks with ease while staying cool and quiet. Thanks to that power-conscious architecture and fan support, the battery life is impressive—lasting just over 19 and a half hours in testing. It doesn’t quite cross the 20-hour threshold, but it comes close enough for nearly anyone’s needs. Fast charging helps make up the difference, reaching 80% in about an hour.

Where the X9 falls short is in connectivity and price. At a starting cost of $1,239, it's pricier than some OLED-equipped competitors, and it omits common ports like USB-A and SD/microSD slots. But if you prioritize portability, display quality, and premium build over expansion options, it's a compelling choice.

This laptop is ideal for frequent travelers who want a light, long-lasting device that won’t slow them down. It’s also a great match for display enthusiasts—anyone who values a vibrant, fast, and color-accurate screen in their everyday machine. For those seeking a MacBook Air alternative with a Windows edge, the ThinkPad X9 delivers refinement in a compact package.

<br/>

Pros: Ultra-lightweight and portable, brilliant 2.8K OLED display, excellent keyboard, wide range of ports for its slim profile

Cons: No SD or microSD card slot, WWAN option not yet available

Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition once again secures its place as the best business laptop on the market. This version builds on the already strong foundation of the X1 Carbon series, offering an ultra-light 2.17-pound chassis, a stunning OLED screen, and Intel’s new CoPilot+ PC-ready Core Ultra 7 258V processor. While it doesn’t aim to be the most powerful laptop in its class, it’s fine-tuned for professionals who value a perfect balance of portability, battery life, and premium usability. Lenovo hasn’t reinvented the wheel here—they’ve simply polished an already exceptional design into something even better.

The laptop’s construction uses a durable blend of magnesium, aluminum, and carbon fiber, resulting in a MIL-STD 810H-certified frame that’s lighter than both the Dell XPS 13 and MacBook Air. Its 2.8K OLED display offers vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making it ideal for both productivity and entertainment. Whether you're working in a bright office or in transit, the screen is built to shine.

Performance is centered on Intel’s new Lunar Lake platform, which focuses more on efficiency and AI-readiness than raw speed. While it won’t top performance charts, it handles all standard work tasks smoothly, from document editing to video calls and multitasking. The new chip also helps dramatically extend battery life—now reaching nearly 19.5 hours in testing, a significant jump from the previous model's 13-hour runtime. It's not the longest-lasting ultraportable, but it’s now highly competitive.

Lenovo’s improvements earn the Gen 13 X1 Carbon another Editors’ Choice award and a rare five-star rating. While it’s still expensive, the premium features justify the cost—especially for those who rely on performance and dependability in a lightweight package.

This laptop is tailor-made for mobile professionals who need something durable, light, and long-lasting for constant travel. It’s also a perfect fit for longtime ThinkPad fans who value Lenovo’s consistent design language, top-tier keyboards, and business-class reliability. For those looking to invest in a high-end work machine, the X1 Carbon Gen 13 is a worthy choice that lives up to the ThinkPad legacy.
