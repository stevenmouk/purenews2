A sharp knife is the most important tool in any kitchen—whether you’re dicing vegetables, carving meat, or slicing through crusty bread, a well-honed blade makes the job faster, safer, and more enjoyable. But even the best knives lose their edge over time, and that’s where a reliable sharpener comes in. From high-end electric machines with professional-level precision to budget-friendly pull-through models for quick touch-ups, we tested a range of sharpeners to find the ones worth your counter space (and your money).

## 1) Best Overall: Chef's Choice 15 Trizor XV, $169

Pros: Works with single-bevel knives, sharpens to a fine 15° edge, includes sharpening, honing, and polishing via strop disc

Cons: No adjustable angle guide, learning curve for beginners

What we like: Featuring three distinct stages, the Trizor can sharpen, hone, and polish virtually any kitchen knife you own. Instead of sliding your blade along a stationary surface like a whetstone or manual pull-through sharpener, the Trizor uses a motor to spin each internal disk, closely imitating the action of a professional grinding belt. Its diamond abrasives handle both sharpening and honing, while a flexible abrasive surface takes care of the final polishing stage. This setup allows the Trizor to put an entirely new edge on your knife and even transform standard 20º blade angles into a sharper, more precise 15º—common on Japanese hybrid-style chef’s knives. Dedicated left- and right-side slots make it capable of sharpening single-bevel Japanese blades, something most electric sharpeners can’t achieve. The pliable polishing wheel can also follow the curves of serrated knife teeth, which is a rare capability in this category. In testing, the Trizor quickly restored our chef’s knives to paper-slicing sharpness in just a few passes. Because it works so fast, it’s convenient to pull out on a busy weeknight to refresh your knife before prepping dinner. The spring-loaded guides keep blades steady, and its solid weight helps it stay firmly in place on the countertop.

What we don't like: While straightforward once you get the hang of it, the Trizor does have a learning curve. Its detailed manual thoroughly explains how to handle different blade types—Western, Japanese, and serrated—each requiring a slightly different technique. With several speed settings, knowing how to operate it properly matters. Like a professional belt grinder, it removes more metal from the blade with each sharpening than a manual option would. This is excellent for giving your knife a brand-new edge, but over time, it will reduce the blade’s overall height.

## 2) Best Budget: Work Sharp Culinary E2, ~~$64~~ $59

<br/>

Pros: Suitable for single-bevel knives, automatic shutoff timer prevents oversharpening

Cons: Blade slots have more looseness than preferred

It may not match the full capabilities of the Trizor, but the Work Sharp E2 costs less than half as much, making it a solid pick for the average home cook.

What we like: The Work Sharp E2 is a simpler electric sharpener than the Trizor, but for many kitchens, it’s more than enough. Setup is quick, operation is straightforward, and it features just two sharpening slots with spinning abrasive discs positioned at opposite angles to grind both sides of the blade to a 20° edge. A ceramic honing slot is included for deburring once the edge is set. A built-in one-minute shutoff prevents oversharpening, which is especially reassuring for beginners. Performance is strong too—blades came out sharp enough to glide through a tomato without resistance. We also appreciated the affordable price and the replaceable grinding discs, which extend the sharpener’s lifespan. It’s an excellent choice for someone who wants to maintain sharp kitchen knives without diving deep into the world of advanced sharpening.

What we don't like: Although its results were impressive, the E2 didn’t quite match the razor edge produced by the Trizor—understandable given the price difference. We also found the blade slots a little less secure than we’d like, but the trade-off is that they can handle a wider variety of knives and even kitchen shears.

## 3) A professional knife sharpener upgrade: Tormek T-1 Kitchen Knife Sharpener, $400

<a href="https://amzn.to/3V2lLBa" target="_blank">

</div>

<br/>

Pros: Adjustable angle guide, professional-grade sharpening discs, capable of sharpening single-bevel knives

Cons: High price, power may be overwhelming for beginners

This is, without question, the best knife sharpener we tested—but its price reflects that. It’s closer to professional-grade gear, making it ideal for experienced cooks ready to take their sharpening game to the next level.

What we like: When it comes to electric sharpeners, the Tormek T-1 takes the crown, no contest. That said, with a cost that’s more than twice the price of the Chef’s Choice, it’s not the most practical choice for the average kitchen. This is a compact, approachable version of the professional sharpeners that Swedish brand Tormek is famous for. Its diamond-coated grinding wheel spins at a slow speed, giving you precise control over how much metal you remove while creating a razor-sharp edge. Adjusting the sharpening angle is simple—just set and lock the angle guide anywhere between 8° and 22°. The freehand adjustment requires a steady hand and a little patience, but clearly marked ticks for each angle make it easy to see your exact setting. A separate honing wheel polishes and deburrs the blade, though it’s important to follow the clear instructions to hone with the edge facing upward to avoid damaging the wheel. Thoughtful touches like a whisper-quiet motor, a built-in magnet to catch metal shavings, and the ability to sharpen one side at a time (perfect for single-bevel knives) make the Tormek stand out.

The T-1 offers the same ease of use as a pull-through sharpener, but with the kind of fine-tuned blade customization you’d normally only get from a whetstone.

What we don't like: This isn’t a flaw with the T-1 itself, but more of a caution for first-time users—it’s a powerful tool, and if you’re not paying attention, you can easily remove more material from your knife than you meant to. The honing wheel also lacks any guiding system, so expect a little trial and error as you figure out the best technique for polishing your edges.

## 4) The Best Manual Sharpener: KitchenIQ Edge Grip 2-Stage Knife Sharpener, ~~$14~~ $10

</div>

<br/>

Pros: Extremely easy to operate, very budget-friendly

Cons: Better suited for upkeep than restoring dull blades

It doesn’t get more basic than the KitchenIQ—but it also doesn’t get more affordable. If you just need something to keep everyday blades in working shape, this little tool handles the job surprisingly well for its low price.

What we like: Pull-through sharpeners often get criticized in the knife world for lacking precision, but at under $10, the KitchenIQ Edge Grip earns a spot on our list. Its straightforward design features two slots: a coarse carbide “V” for sharpening and a ceramic slot for honing. In our testing, it noticeably improved the edge on some of our duller knives. Think of it as a more assertive version of a honing steel—it won’t fully restore a blade the way a whetstone or electric sharpener can, but it will refine the existing edge. And thanks to its compact size, it’s easy to use regularly—running your knives through the honing slot every couple of uses is quick and convenient.

What we don't like: There’s no sugarcoating it—this isn’t going to match the performance of a whetstone or electric sharpener. It’s meant for upkeep, not a full blade reset. The sharpening “V” is fixed at a 20° angle, so there’s no flexibility for other edge types. Still, for the price, it performs exactly as we’d hope.
