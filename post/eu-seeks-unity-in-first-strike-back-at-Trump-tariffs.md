European Union nations are preparing to show a unified stance in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, with an initial package of retaliatory measures likely to target up to $28 billion worth of American goods—ranging from dental floss to diamonds—in the coming days.

If approved, the move would align the EU with countries like China and Canada in striking back against Washington’s trade measures, marking an early escalation in what many fear could spiral into a full-blown global trade war—raising prices for consumers and threatening to slow economies worldwide.

The 27-country EU bloc is facing 25% U.S. import tariffs on steel, aluminium, and cars, and additional “reciprocal” tariffs of 20% on nearly all other products starting Wednesday.

Trump’s tariffs now affect roughly 70% of EU exports to the United States—worth €532 billion ($585 billion) last year—with further duties expected soon on goods such as copper, semiconductors, timber, and pharmaceuticals.

Late Monday, the European Commission, which manages trade policy for the bloc, plans to present a proposed list of American imports that would face additional EU tariffs. Rather than applying blanket countermeasures, this list will specifically address Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs.

The targeted products reportedly include U.S. meat, cereals, clothing, wine, wood, chewing gum, toilet paper, vacuum cleaners, and dental floss.

One item in particular—bourbon—has sparked heated debate within the bloc. The Commission is proposing a steep 50% tariff on the American spirit, which prompted Trump to threaten retaliatory duties of 200% on EU alcoholic beverages if Brussels moves forward.

France and Italy, both major wine exporters, have voiced concern. With its economy built on open trade, the EU is aiming to secure wide backing for its response, ensuring maximum pressure on Washington while keeping a door open for negotiations.

On Monday, Luxembourg will host the first political gathering of EU trade ministers since Trump’s announcement, where representatives from all 27 member states will discuss the situation and coordinate strategy.

Diplomats say the primary objective is to present a united front: one that expresses a clear desire to negotiate but also signals the EU is ready to impose countermeasures if talks fail.

“Our greatest fear post-Brexit was that bilateral deals would splinter EU unity, but even after years of difficult negotiations, that didn’t happen. This is a different challenge, but everyone understands the value of a common trade policy,” one diplomat noted.

EU countries remain divided on how forceful their response should be. France has argued for a broader, more strategic package, with President Emmanuel Macron even suggesting EU businesses suspend U.S. investments until there’s clarity.

Ireland—heavily reliant on U.S. trade, with nearly one-third of its exports headed there—has called for a calm, balanced response. Italy, the EU’s third-largest exporter to the U.S., has questioned whether hitting back is the right approach at all.

“It’s a delicate situation,” said one diplomat. “We need to be firm enough to bring the U.S. to the negotiating table, but not so aggressive that we provoke escalation.”

So far, talks with Washington have yielded little. EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic described his meeting with U.S. officials on Friday as “frank,” and reiterated that the tariffs were “damaging and unjustified.”

The initial list of EU countermeasures will go to a vote on Wednesday and is expected to pass unless a qualified majority—15 member states representing 65% of the EU population—votes against it, which is unlikely.

If approved, the tariffs would be rolled out in two phases: the first set on April 15, with the remainder following a month later.

Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with CEOs from the steel, auto, and pharmaceutical sectors on Monday and Tuesday to assess the impact of the tariffs and chart next steps.
