Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused US special envoy Steve Witkoff of "spreading Russian narratives" after Witkoff suggested that peace between Ukraine and Russia hinges on the status of five disputed regions.

Witkoff made the comments after a five-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday. Speaking to Fox News, he said the war "comes down to these so-called five territories."

"Mr. Witkoff seems to have adopted the Russian strategy," Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv on Thursday. "That’s dangerous—whether he means to or not, he’s promoting Russian narratives."

Witkoff appeared to be referencing the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson in eastern Ukraine, much of which remain under Russian control following Putin’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The fifth region is believed to be Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014—an act not recognized by the international community.

"These regions are ours. They belong to our people, and to future generations of Ukrainians. So I don’t really know what he’s talking about," Zelensky added.

In his Fox News interview, Witkoff said: "The peace deal is about these so-called five territories. But it’s much bigger than that… I think we may be approaching something significant on the global stage."

He also hinted at a broader opportunity to "reshape US-Russia relations" through "strong commercial opportunities that could bring real stability to the region."

Washington and Moscow have been exploring avenues to restore diplomatic ties.

This isn't the first time Zelensky has taken issue with Witkoff. Back in March, he dismissed the envoy’s credentials: "He doesn’t look like a military man. He’s not a general. From what I understand, he’s good at buying and selling real estate. That’s something else entirely."

Zelensky’s latest remarks come just after a high-level meeting in Paris involving US, Ukrainian, and European diplomats—including Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio—to discuss the ongoing war.

Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump took another jab at Zelensky on Thursday. While walking back earlier claims that the Ukrainian president had started the war, Trump made it clear he isn’t impressed.

"I don’t hold Zelensky responsible, but I’m not exactly thrilled with how things have gone," Trump said. "I’m not blaming him, but I wouldn’t say he’s done the best job. I’m not a big fan."

Zelensky also told reporters that Ukraine now has evidence China is supplying weapons to Russia.

"We finally have confirmation that China is delivering weapons to the Russian Federation," he said. "We believe Chinese representatives are even involved in manufacturing some of these weapons on Russian soil."

China has not responded to the claims, but has consistently positioned itself as a neutral actor in the conflict. Last week, when Zelensky alleged that Chinese nationals were fighting alongside Russian forces, Beijing urged "relevant parties to correctly and soberly understand China's role and avoid irresponsible statements."
