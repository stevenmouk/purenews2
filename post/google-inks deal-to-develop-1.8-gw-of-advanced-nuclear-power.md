Google and nuclear startup Elementl Power revealed this week that they’re teaming up to develop three advanced nuclear reactor sites.

As Google’s AI growth drives soaring electricity needs at its data centers, the company has been scrambling to secure power sources. In 2024 alone, it’s planning to pour $75 billion into expanding its data center infrastructure.

Under this new partnership, Google commits to bringing at least 600 megawatts of generation capacity online at each of the three locations. Elementl noted that the reactors will be grid-connected “with the option for commercial off-take,” allowing Google to directly purchase the electricity.

Until now, Elementl has operated quietly. While the team has nuclear industry experience, the company hasn’t developed any power facilities yet. It was founded by Breakwater North and is financially backed by Energy Impact Partners.

The company hasn’t chosen a specific small modular reactor (SMR) provider yet and describes its approach as “technology agnostic.” Kairos Power is seen as a strong contender, given its existing relationship with Google.

Kairos’ demonstration plant is expected to produce 50 megawatts, while its future commercial setup aims to deliver 150 megawatts via two reactors.

Though definitions vary, SMRs are generally capped at around 300 megawatts. For perspective, the latest nuclear plant built in the U.S.—Vogtle Unit 4 in Georgia—produces over 1.1 gigawatts, nearly four times the output of a large SMR.

Interest in SMRs has surged in Silicon Valley. Startups have entered the field en masse, pitching cost reductions through factory-built reactors and offering around-the-clock, on-site power for data centers. That’s led to several deals with firms like Oklo, X-Energy, and Kairos.

Still, no SMRs have gone into operation outside China. NuScale came close but faced a major setback in 2023 when its utility partner canceled their agreement after projected costs more than doubled—even after the project was scaled down to save money.
