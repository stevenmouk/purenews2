Pros: This carry-on packs a surprising amount of space into a compact, easy-to-maneuver design.

Cons: After months of use, the exterior may show some minor scratches.

The Samsonite Freeform Carry-on Spinner has consistently earned high marks in our testing—and it's easy to see why. We've put this suitcase through multiple rounds of evaluation in our New York City testing lab, and every time, it’s impressed us with its smart storage, roomy interior, and excellent value.

Despite its modest size, the Freeform holds enough for a week-long trip. During testing, we easily packed for four days—including two pairs of shoes, several jackets, and a couple of toiletry kits—without even needing the expansion feature. If you’re someone who tends to overpack or anticipates doing a little shopping on your trip, the expandable zipper adds an extra inch of depth, perfect for stashing souvenirs or new purchases.

Handling-wise, this suitcase is a standout. It glides smoothly, handles corners with ease, and even passed our curb test without trouble. We also tested its durability by striking it with a metal bat. While the outer shell flexed slightly, it didn’t dent and kept everything inside safe—ideal for when you're forced to check your bag at the gate.

Over time, we did notice some cosmetic wear like surface scratches, especially with frequent travel. However, the structural integrity held up exceptionally well. One note: it might not fit in the overhead bins of every airline, so it’s wise to confirm carry-on size limits before flying.

Specs: Hardside | 23 x 15 x 10 inches | 6.5 pounds | Expandable (1 inch) | Polycarbonate | 4 dual spinner wheels

## 2) The Best Overall Carry on Luggage, Runner Up: Tumi Alpha International Dual Access Carry-on, ~~$778~~ $622

Pros: Convenient access pockets and a removable garment sleeve make this a highly functional carry-on for business or formal travel.

Cons: It’s heavier than most softside suitcases due to its reinforced frame and rugged nylon exterior.

A strong runner-up to our top pick, the Tumi Alpha Dual Access Carry-on is a premium piece of luggage packed with thoughtful features. While it didn’t quite secure the top spot due to its heavier weight and less open packing space, it excels in organization and durability—making it ideal for frequent flyers, especially those traveling for work or events.

One of the standout features is the front access panel, which allows for easy retrieval of essentials like a sweater, book, or charging cable without opening the entire bag. A second exterior pocket adds space for smaller items, and there's even a built-in USB port you can connect to your power bank to keep your devices charged on the go.

Perhaps the biggest draw is the removable garment sleeve, a rare inclusion that makes this suitcase especially useful for business trips or weddings where you need to pack formalwear. The bag also includes three internal mesh zip pockets to help keep everything organized. Keep in mind that these organizational features can cut into the main storage space, so efficient packing is key. Fortunately, an expandable zipper provides an additional 2 inches of space when needed.

When it comes to durability, the Tumi Alpha really shines. During our lab testing, this bag held up flawlessly—even after repeated blows from a metal bat, it showed no signs of wear. Tumi fans praise the brand for its long-lasting build, and our own testers agree: this is a suitcase that’s made to last for decades.

Though it comes at a premium price, the Tumi Alpha is an investment in reliability and long-term use, perfect for those who travel often and expect top-tier performance from their luggage.

Specs: Softside | 22 x 14 x 9 inches | 10.7 pounds | 35-liter capacity | Expandable (2 inches) | USB port | Ballistic nylon | 4 dual spinner wheels

## 3) Best Budget Pick: Amazon Basics Expandable Hardside 21-inch Spinner, $53

Pros: It’s impressively lightweight and surprisingly spacious for a budget carry-on.

Cons: Color choices are limited, which may be a downside if you’re looking for variety.

If you think sticking to a tight budget means giving up on quality luggage, the Amazon Basics 21-inch Expandable Hardside Spinner will change your mind. This affordable carry-on consistently punches above its weight, delivering capacity and features that rival more expensive options.

In our testing lab, this compact spinner impressed us with its efficient design. Inside, it offers the same roomy interior found in pricier models and includes thoughtful touches like a mesh zip divider for organizing smaller items and an X-strap to keep clothes in place. Even with its compact frame, it can accommodate everything you need for a long weekend.

The exterior includes four small feet on the side so the suitcase can sit horizontally—handy when you're loading it into a trunk or weighing it at the airport. While the telescoping handle felt slightly loose during testing, the adjustable height settings worked smoothly and didn’t hinder mobility.

As with most expandable bags, it’s worth noting that when fully expanded, this suitcase may appear bulkier and could draw the attention of airline staff. But for the price, that’s a small tradeoff.

Over multiple rounds of testing, this Amazon Basics suitcase held up well. It sustained some scuffing after our durability tests (involving hits from a metal bat), but the scratches were easily polished away by hand. With a sub-$100 price tag, this carry-on delivers excellent value and is a smart pick for travelers who want function without the frills.

Specs: Hardside | 21.7 x 14.8 x 10 inches | 6.8 pounds | 34-liter capacity | Expandable (2 inches) | Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) | 4 dual spinner wheels

## 4) Best Compression Carry on Luggage: Briggs & Riley 22 Inch Spinner, $695

<br/>

Pros: Its unique push-button expansion system adds 25% more space instantly—no tugging on zippers required.

Cons: It showed some wear at the base after durability testing.

Briggs & Riley has long been known for crafting premium luggage, and the 22-inch Expandable Hardside Spinner lives up to the reputation. While it carries a higher price tag, this carry-on offers advanced features and smart engineering that make it a worthy investment for frequent travelers.

What sets this suitcase apart is its button-activated expansion system. Instead of the typical zipper expansion, this innovative design lets you press buttons on either side of the interior compartment to lift the shell and create 25% more space. It’s intuitive, smooth, and lets you pack more without struggling.

Inside, the bag features a built-in compression pad that helps you pack efficiently—even when fully loaded. Though it isn’t removable, it was highly effective in maximizing space. Other thoughtful details include a back-facing external pocket where you can store a power bank and thread a charging cable through, plus a high-quality drawstring laundry bag for organization.

The exterior is made from recycled polycarbonate and feels solid and high-end. During our lab tests, it handled impact from a metal bat without denting, though the base did pick up some scratches when dragged over concrete. The telescoping handle is made from aircraft-grade aluminum, and the 360-degree spinner wheels rolled smoothly through obstacle courses.

While it's not completely immune to wear and tear, the lifetime guarantee adds tremendous peace of mind—Briggs & Riley will repair your suitcase for free, with no proof of purchase required.

Specs: Hardside | 22 x 14 x 9 inches | 8.6 pounds | 41-liter capacity (unexpanded); 51-liter capacity (expanded) | Expandable | Recycled polycarbonate, recycled polyester | 4 dual spinner wheels

<br/>

Pros: It blends vintage-inspired style with a tough, travel-ready shell.

Cons: The limited internal space makes it better suited for minimal packers.

The Delsey Paris Chatelet Air Carry-On continues to be a favorite among Travel + Leisure editors—and it’s easy to see why. This elegant suitcase brings together old-school charm and modern functionality in a lightweight, easy-to-roll design that stands out in a crowd.

Its durable polycarbonate shell is styled with reinforced corners and a sophisticated two-tone finish, offering both beauty and protection. While its appearance gives off a vintage vibe, the features are thoroughly modern. Inside, the bag offers thoughtful organization: one side features a fully zippered panel, while the other includes compression straps to keep everything in place. There are also built-in pockets for small accessories and a USB port that allows you to connect your own power bank—ideal for charging on the go.

In testing, the zippers were smooth and snag-free, and the dual spinner wheels glided easily—even over carpeted surfaces. One of our editors took the cream-colored model on a two-week trip through Egypt and was impressed by its resilience. Despite being checked and hauled around on multiple trains and staircases, the bag showed only minor marks—an impressive feat for light-colored luggage.

Its compact size and light weight also make it perfect for navigating tight spaces, lifting overhead, or carrying upstairs. Just keep in mind that the capacity is on the smaller side, so it’s best for shorter trips or travelers who pack light.

Specs: Hardside | 22.75 x 15 x 10 inches | 7.74 pounds | 44-liter capacity | USB port | Polycarbonate | 4 dual spinner wheels
