Donald Trump has hinted that a meeting with the King in the UK is being lined up for September.

The former US president described himself as a “friend of Charles” and expressed “great respect” for the monarch when questioned about reports suggesting he would visit Britain at the end of the summer.

Trump was previously welcomed with a lavish state visit by the late Queen in 2019 during his first term in office.

Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, he remarked that he wasn’t sure “how it can be bigger than the last one,” but noted that “they say it’s going to be even more important.”

Buckingham Palace has not commented on the potential visit.

When asked if he’d be meeting King Charles in September, Trump replied: “I was invited by the King and the country — a great country.

“They’re doing a second… a second fest, that’s what it is: a fest. It’s beautiful, and it’s the first time it’s ever happened for one person.

“The reason is, we have two separate terms, and it’s an honour… I’m a friend of Charles, I have great respect for King Charles and the family — William, we really have just great respect for the family.

“And I think they’re setting a date for September.”

Asked if the occasion would be smaller than last time, he said: “I don’t know how it can be bigger than the last one.

“The last one was, as you know, incredible. But they say it’s going to be even more important, so it’s a great honour to be so chosen.”

Traditionally, US presidents on a second term who have already received a state visit are hosted for a tea or lunch at Windsor Castle — as was the case for George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

During a February trip to the White House, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer personally delivered what he called a “truly historic” invitation from the King, inviting Trump for a second state visit.

According to The Telegraph, the September meeting is now expected to take place at Windsor Castle, rather than Balmoral or Dumfries House as previously suggested.

This comes as the UK Government continues to pursue a broader economic deal with Washington aimed at offsetting Trump’s 10% tariffs on all American imports.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is due in the US next week for talks, confirmed that “active negotiations” are still in progress.

“I will also be having conversations with the US administration whilst I’m there,” she said on Thursday.

Later that day, however, the president played down the prospect of any immediate breakthroughs.

“We’re in no rush,” Trump said, noting that deals with other countries would happen “at a certain point.”

“We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do,” he added.
