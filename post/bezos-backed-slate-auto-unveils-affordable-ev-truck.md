Slate Auto, a startup partially funded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has announced an affordable electric pickup truck that transforms into an SUV — with a starting price of just $20,000 after federal EV incentives.

Billed as “a radically simple electric pickup truck that can change into whatever you need it to be — even an SUV,” Slate’s website emphasizes the vehicle’s versatility and low cost. “Made in the USA at a price that’s actually affordable (no really, for real),” the company adds.

The compact two-door truck can convert into a five-seat SUV. It’s significantly smaller than competitors, measuring about two-thirds the size of a Chevy Silverado EV and roughly seven-eighths the size of a Ford Maverick. Still, it offers a payload capacity of 1,400 pounds, close to the Maverick’s 1,500-pound limit.

At under 15 feet in length, Slate says its truck is more comparable to a 1985 Toyota pickup than any modern rival.

This minimalist approach is intentional. Described by TechCrunch as an “anti-Tesla,” the base model skips premium features — there’s no infotainment screen or power windows. Both the Slate and Tesla’s Cybertruck offer customization, but the Slate Truck sticks to essential elements.

The vehicle boasts a maximum range of 150 miles per charge, with an optional extended battery offering up to 240 miles. Slate says its EVs are designed in California and Michigan, engineered in Michigan, and assembled in the Midwest — reportedly in Indiana, according to TechCrunch.

Earlier this month, TechCrunch also revealed that Slate raised $111 million in funding, with backers including Bezos, Los Angeles Dodgers principal owner Mark Walter, and investor Thomas Tull. SEC filings name Melinda Lewison, who heads Bezos’ family office, as a Slate Auto board member.

Though deliveries aren’t expected until late 2026, interested buyers can reserve a vehicle now for a refundable $50 deposit.
