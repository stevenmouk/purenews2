Nintendo announced Friday that several Switch 2 accessories will now cost more than originally planned due to changing market conditions. While the console’s price and the cost of Nintendo’s first-party games remain unchanged for now, the company cautioned that “further price adjustments for any Nintendo product could happen in the future depending on market trends.”

This update follows the rescheduling of Switch 2 preorders in the U.S., which are now set to begin on April 24. Preorders were initially supposed to launch on April 9 but were pushed back as Nintendo evaluated the potential impact of tariffs and shifting market dynamics. “We apologize for the delay in retail preorders and hope this helps ease some of the uncertainty our customers are facing,” the company said in its Friday statement.

Here are the updated prices for the Switch 2’s official accessories, with the previously announced April 2 prices shown in parentheses:

Switch 2 Pro Controller: $84.99 ~~($79.99)~~

Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Controllers: $94.99 ~~($89.99)~~

Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $39.99 ~~($34.99)~~

Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Straps: $13.99 ~~($12.99)~~

Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheels: $24.99 ~~($19.99)~~

Switch 2 Camera: $54.99 ~~($49.99)~~

Switch 2 Dock Set: $119.99 ~~($109.99)~~

Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $39.99 ~~($34.99)~~

Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $84.99 ~~($79.99)~~

Switch 2 AC Adapter: $34.99 ~~($29.99)~~

The Switch 2 console itself is still priced at $449.99, and a $499.99 bundle featuring a digital copy of Mario Kart World is also still planned. However, Nintendo noted that the bundle will only be available “through Fall 2025” and “while supplies last.” Mario Kart World will be sold separately for $79.99, while Donkey Kong Bananza is set to release in July at a $69.99 MSRP.

Most industry watchers had anticipated Nintendo would keep the Switch 2’s pricing steady, despite the threat of increased manufacturing costs from tariffs on Chinese and Vietnamese goods. “I think it’s now too late for Nintendo to raise the price, if that was ever on the table,” said Serkan Toto of Kantan Games in a statement to GamesIndustry.biz. “Just like everyone else, Nintendo didn’t have clarity on tariffs until April 2. As a hardware maker, they probably ran a lot of scenarios to settle on a price that could mostly withstand the impact of tariffs.”

Still, those prices might not stay put forever. “If tariffs continue, we could see a price bump in 2026,” said Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis to GameSpot. “Nintendo will proceed cautiously, knowing how vital the U.S. market is.”

Since the Switch 2’s reveal earlier this month, Nintendo’s promotional livestreams have been flooded with comments urging the company to “DROP THE PRICE.”
