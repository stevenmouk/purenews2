The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled new fees targeting Chinese-built ships, following a U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) investigation—initiated under the Biden administration and concluded by the Trump team—that found China’s actions in the shipbuilding sector to be unfair and harmful to U.S. trade.

“Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,” said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. “The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships.”

According to the USTR, China’s grip on global shipbuilding stems from aggressive industrial targeting, leaving U.S. companies and workers at a major disadvantage.

Unlike the original draft plan, which proposed charging fees at each U.S. port a ship visited, the final version imposes a fee only once per voyage.

The policy—first developed under the Biden administration—grew from a January report that concluded China’s shipbuilding advantage was the result of unfair practices. The final rule enables the U.S. to place steep fees on Chinese-built ships arriving at American ports. Initially, the draft policy called for service fees of up to $1 million per vessel operated by Chinese-owned carriers like Cosco. For other carriers operating Chinese-built ships, the proposed fee was up to $1.5 million per U.S. port of call.

This framework was revised following two days of public hearings in March, during which over 300 trade organizations and industry voices warned that the U.S. could struggle in an economic conflict where nearly all commercial ships—soon to be 98%—are Chinese-built.

Vessel operators may qualify for a fee waiver if they can prove they’ve ordered a U.S.-made ship. The exemption is based on the tonnage of the ordered vessel. If the vessel isn’t delivered within three years, the suspended fees become immediately payable.

Fee Schedule For the first 180 days, all fees will be set at $0. After that, charges are based on a vessel’s net tonnage. Container ships typically range from 50,000 to 220,000 tons.

Fees for Operators and Owners of Chinese Vessels:

April 17, 2025: $0 per net ton

October 14, 2025: $50 per net ton

April 17, 2026: $80 per net ton

April 17, 2027: $110 per net ton

April 17, 2028: $140 per net ton

Fees are capped at five charges per vessel per year. The rule does not specify per-container pricing.

Fees for Operators of Chinese-Built (But Not Chinese-Owned) Vessels:

April 17, 2025: $0 per container

October 14, 2025: $18 per net ton (~$120/container)

April 17, 2026: $23 per net ton (~$153/container)

April 17, 2027: $28 per net ton (~$195/container)

April 17, 2028: $33 per net ton (~$250/container)

These charges also apply a maximum of five times annually per ship.

Additionally, foreign-built car carriers will face fees based on capacity, starting at $150 per Car Equivalent Unit (CEU) within 180 days.

A second phase of action will launch in three years, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels. Restrictions on LNG transport via foreign ships will gradually intensify over the next 22 years.

If an ocean carrier can prove they’ve ordered a U.S.-built vessel, the related fees and restrictions on their non-U.S. ship may be suspended for up to three years.

Certain sectors are exempt from these fees, including Great Lakes and Caribbean shipping routes, U.S. territories, and shipments of bulk commodities like coal or grain. Empty vessels arriving at ports will also not be subject to the new charges.
