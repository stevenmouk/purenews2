Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has issued a warning that demand for the Switch 2 in Japan has significantly outpaced expectations, meaning many fans won’t be able to get their hands on the console when it launches.

In a message posted on X (translated by Google), Furukawa revealed that roughly 2.2 million people in Japan are trying to purchase the Switch 2 through the My Nintendo Store’s lottery system.

He acknowledged that this figure has "far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store [at launch] on June 5th."

"Therefore, unfortunately, we expect that a significant number of customers will not be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow, April 24th," Furukawa said.

Those who don’t win in the first round of the lottery won’t need to reapply—they’ll automatically be entered into a second draw. Still, Nintendo cautioned that even this next round won’t be able to satisfy the full demand.

"Even including the quantity for the second lottery sale, we cannot fulfill all of the applications we received. We deeply apologize for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations," Furukawa added.

In response to the overwhelming interest, Nintendo is working to ramp up its production capabilities. Fans will also have a chance to pre-order the console from third-party retailers starting April 24, 2025.

After launch, the Switch 2 will continue to be available through the My Nintendo Store, with more information about that rollout coming soon.

Still, the company is clearly preparing fans for a tough launch.

"With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands," Furukawa said.

"We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologize for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding."
