South Korea has taken a historic step toward LGBTQ+ inclusion by announcing that same-sex couples will now be officially recognized in the national census.

According to new policy updates, the Ministry of Data and Statistics will include same-sex couples living together as part of the Population and Housing Census. Starting with the next census, which is conducted every five years, same-gender households will be allowed to select “spouse” or “cohabiting partner” — options that were previously rejected as invalid entries.

In earlier surveys, these selections were automatically flagged as errors, effectively erasing same-sex couples from the country’s official data, according to Rainbow Action Korea, a coalition of 49 LGBTQ+ advocacy groups. “This marks the first step toward ensuring LGBTQ+ citizens are properly represented in national statistics,” the coalition said in a statement reported by The Straits Times.

Although South Korea still does not legally recognize same-sex marriage, progress has been emerging in other areas. In 2023, cohabiting same-sex partners gained eligibility for spousal benefits under the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). A 2024 court ruling reaffirming this right was celebrated as a major victory for LGBTQ+ equality and seen as a possible precursor to marriage equality.

The centre-left Justice Party welcomed the government’s move to modernize the census, saying it could “open the door to broader social change.” The party’s spokesperson added, “One day, even transgender citizens will be reflected in national statistics.”

Still, LGBTQ+ rights in South Korea remain limited. Adoption and military service are off-limits to LGBTQ+ individuals, and the country lacks hate crime protections. While transgender people have been able to change their legal gender without sterilization since 2020, access to gender-affirming healthcare is still tightly restricted.

Public opinion also remains divided. A 2025 Ipsos poll revealed that 31% of South Koreans hold anti-LGBTQ+ views, and 51% disapprove of same-sex couples showing affection in public. Yet, nearly one in four respondents said they believe South Korea is a “good place” for LGBTQ+ people.

Rainbow Action welcomed the census update but criticized the government for failing to adequately publicize the change — a shortcoming they fear could prevent many same-sex couples from being counted.
