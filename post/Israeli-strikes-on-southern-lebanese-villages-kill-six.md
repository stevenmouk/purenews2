Israeli airstrikes on two villages in southern Lebanon have left six people dead and five injured, according to a statement by Lebanon's health ministry on Saturday. The incidents come amid mounting pressure on a tenuous ceasefire that has been in effect for less than two weeks.

The ministry reported that five individuals lost their lives in Beit Lif village, while another person was killed in a drone strike targeting Deir Seryan. The Israeli military has not yet issued a response regarding the attacks.

Despite the ceasefire, tensions remain high, with Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah accusing each other of violations. Earlier this week, Israel warned it might resume hostilities if the truce with Hezbollah were to break down.

The U.S. commented last Monday that the ceasefire appeared to be holding but acknowledged the potential for breaches.
