## 1) The Best Overall Noise Canceling Earbuds: Sony WF-1000XM5, ~~$329~~ $213

The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds come with several notable advantages: they boast a more ergonomic design, exceptional noise cancellation, crystal-clear sound quality, and convenient features like built-in touch controls and wireless charging. On the downside, they are quite pricey.

So why do we like them? Fans eagerly awaited Sony’s release of the WF-1000XM5, and it turns out the wait was well worth it. These earbuds set a new benchmark for noise-canceling performance in 2025. Building on the already impressive XM4, Sony managed to make the housing smaller and more comfortable while extending battery life and reducing charging times — now just a quick three-minute charge delivers an hour of playback. Of course, it’s not only about noise cancellation; the superb audio tuning makes these earbuds sound outstanding, putting them well ahead of most competitors. Though they come with a hefty price tag, the investment feels justified, especially for frequent travelers and commuters who’ll get the most from their top-tier features.

## 2) The Best Overall Noise Canceling Earbuds, Runner Up: Sony WF-1000XM4, $229

These wireless earbuds stand out for several reasons. They deliver the best sound quality you’ll find in a pair that also features noise-canceling technology, boast powerful ANC with multiple modes, and are built with impressive craftsmanship. The main downside is their relatively high price.

Why do we recommend them? It took Sony three generations to perfect their 1000 series earbuds, but with the WF-1000XM4, they’ve finally nailed it. Earlier models struggled with various flaws and underwhelming sound, but the XM4 has completely transformed expectations for noise-canceling true wireless earbuds.

Sony shines in two critical areas. First is audio performance — the WF-1000XM4 sounds outstanding, staying true to Sony’s signature style with punchy bass, rich sub-bass, and warm yet smooth mids. They handle all music genres well, offering clarity and detail that surpass most other ANC earbuds.

Second is the advanced noise-canceling technology. The WF-1000XM4 delivers such strong ANC that it rivals what you’d expect from full-size headphones. We also appreciate the robust Sony headphone app, which lets you fine-tune the sound to atmospheric conditions and easily toggle between ambient and pass-through modes. All of this makes them a top choice despite their premium price.

## 3) Best For Iphone Users: Apple Airpods Pro (2nd Gen) USB-C, $249

These earbuds come with several standout advantages: they integrate flawlessly with Apple devices, making them the top pick for iPhone users, offer a very comfortable and secure fit thanks to a redesigned shape, and are rated IPX4 for resistance against splashes, sweat, and water. On the downside, they’re quite expensive, and the built-in battery can’t be replaced, which means it will inevitably degrade over time.

So why do we like them? The Apple AirPods Pro recently received a major update, earning them a spot on our list for the first time. To be frank, the original AirPods Pro were overpriced, didn’t deliver the best sound, and were starting to feel outdated. This new version may be more of an evolution than a total redesign, but it brings welcome improvements — notably, Apple finally added USB-C charging, so you’ll likely need just one cable for all your devices.

Apple users have long wanted a better earphone, and the new AirPods Pro delivers. They swap the old hard plastic shape for silicone tips that create a secure seal in the ear canal, dramatically improving fit and comfort. Their noise cancellation is second only to Sony’s, making them the best AirPods yet for use in noisy environments. They’re compact, pocket-friendly with their case, offer excellent battery life, and are comfortable enough for long wear. While they are the priciest wireless ANC earbuds on our list, their features — including an outstanding transparency mode that’s ideal for runners — make them easy to recommend.

## 4) Best For Comfort: Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, ~~$279~~ $249

These earbuds come with some strong advantages: they’re backed by an excellent reputation, feature outstanding noise-canceling performance that lives up to Bose’s legacy, and have an ergonomic design that stays comfortable even during all-day use. The only drawback is the rather large Bose logo on the housing, which can feel a bit too prominent when worn.

Why do we like them? The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II mark Bose’s impressive return to the top tier of noise-canceling earbuds, after earlier models failed to stand out. Despite Bose’s long-standing prestige in the ANC headphone world, their previous earbuds often missed the mark in both style and fit, allowing competitors like Sony to surge ahead.

With the QuietComfort II, Bose has righted those missteps. These earbuds not only improve dramatically on the physical design—offering a comfortable, secure fit with plenty of ear tip options—but also deliver noise cancelation that rivals the very best in the category. The ANC quality is so good it closely mimics the experience of wearing Bose’s over-ear headphones, without the pressure or hollow sensation that cheaper earbuds often create.

They’re also incredibly comfortable, making it easy to wear them for hours without irritation. While they sit at the higher end of the price range, their performance justifies the investment. Really, the only gripe is that the oversized Bose logo can dominate the look when they’re in your ears. Overall, though, these are hard to beat if top-notch noise cancelation and comfort are your priorities.

If you think top performance always comes with a top-dollar price tag, think again. These earbuds deliver incredible value, rivaling big-name flagships without the hefty cost. They’re arguably the best-looking on our list, loaded with the most advanced tech features, and yet the only real drawback is that they can be harder to find in stores.

So why do we love them? Simply put, price isn’t everything — we judge headphones by how they perform, and the Liberty 4 from Soundcore holds its own against industry heavyweights like Sony, Bose, and Apple. If I were buying true wireless earbuds today for their noise-canceling abilities, these would be my pick. Soundcore has shown it’s serious about the headphone market, and the Liberty 4 is proof. This flagship model looks and feels high-end, with a premium build that matches its impressive specs.

In our tests, their noise cancelation actually outperformed Sony and Bose, and they were more comfortable for long listening sessions too. They also stand out with a sleek design and the most tech-packed feature set we’ve seen — including a heart rate sensor, dual drivers, and spatial audio. As for sound, they’re right up there with Apple, just a notch below Sony, delivering an energetic, bass-rich listening experience.

Best of all, they cost less than half of what you’d pay for the big brands. Remember, with names like Bose or Sony, a chunk of the price goes to marketing. Anker, Soundcore’s parent company, doesn’t pour nearly as much into advertising, which lets them offer this kind of quality at such a compelling price.
