Poland is exploring ways to collaborate with the UK and other European nations to enhance defense production while optimizing costs for taxpayers, its finance minister has said. The move comes as European countries respond to U.S. pressure to strengthen their military capabilities.

Andrzej Domański emphasized that European nations must take greater responsibility for their security by increasing spending while ensuring efficiency. He revealed that he discussed new approaches to defense funding with UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during a meeting in London on Wednesday.

Poland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has invited Reeves to further discussions at a European finance ministers' meeting in Warsaw next month, which will also feature Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's finance minister and former NATO secretary-general.

“I strongly believe that Poland and the UK share a similar approach to defense,” Domański told the Financial Times, adding that securing defense funding remains his top priority in conversations with both EU and UK counterparts.

As NATO's highest defense spender relative to GDP, Poland has been urging European allies to boost their military investments amid Russian aggression in Ukraine and former U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for Europe to shoulder greater defense responsibilities.

Domański and Reeves previously met during the G20 finance ministers' summit in Cape Town last month, where they discussed potential mechanisms for coordinating defense investments.

Ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, the European Commission unveiled a €150 billion rearmament fund. However, British-made weapons would only be eligible for the program if the UK signs a defense and security agreement with the EU.

Despite this, several EU nations are actively seeking ways to integrate the UK into the bloc's defense initiatives. “As a country committed to strengthening European defense capabilities, we are also open to cooperation with non-EU members,” Domański said, noting that discussions were still in early stages.

He underscored a shared goal of reducing defense costs while ensuring efficient use of taxpayer funds and supporting European small and medium-sized enterprises. Poland’s proposals will be discussed further at the informal Ecofin meeting in Warsaw next month. While EU-wide solutions are preferred, Domański acknowledged that alternative approaches may be necessary if consensus cannot be reached.

Domański also advocated for a "buy European" strategy, positioning defense spending as a tool to bolster domestic industries. “Building a strong European defense sector is a priority,” he said. “It’s always best to buy Polish, and if not, then European.”

Regarding the UK’s role, he stated, “We discussed various options with the chancellor and agreed that taxpayers’ money must be spent efficiently. There is significant potential to improve this through smarter spending tools.”

Officials believe that pooling resources on equipment purchases could help European governments secure better defense contracts. Additionally, they are evaluating ways to involve private sector funding in military investments.

A UK government spokesperson welcomed efforts to boost European defense production, stating, “European allies must step up, and we need a unified approach that brings efforts together and drives further action.”

The talks in London coincided with UK preparations to convene senior military planners from around 30 nations engaged in a “coalition of the willing” supporting Ukraine. Thursday’s meeting will focus on the operational framework of an Anglo-French-led “reassurance force” that could be deployed in Ukraine post-ceasefire. UK Defense Secretary John Healey is among the key participants.

Held at the British Armed Forces headquarters in Northwood, Hertfordshire, the gathering aims to foster trust among allies while refining strategic coordination. Discussions will include whether nations willing to deploy forces in Ukraine could reassign troops already stationed in NATO regions, allowing other coalition members to backfill their positions.

The UK expressed disappointment over Russia’s reluctance to agree to an unconditional ceasefire, following a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump on Tuesday.

A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer commented, “We welcome President Trump’s efforts to secure a ceasefire, but it is disappointing that Putin has not agreed to an immediate, unconditional cessation of hostilities, as Ukraine has done.”
