The Trump administration is reportedly exploring a plan to offer each resident of Greenland about $10,000 as part of its broader effort to annex the island.

This proposal would effectively replace the $600 million in annual subsidies Greenland currently receives from Denmark and, according to The New York Times, has progressed beyond mere speculation to become an official U.S. policy initiative.

The Times reports that multiple cabinet departments are already involved, and the National Security Council has held several meetings to push the plan forward, recently dispatching detailed directives to relevant agencies.

An administration official told the NYT that the approach is focused on persuasion rather than pressure, and military action has not been seriously considered as part of the plan.

Officials have also begun studying the full financial implications of annexation, including the cost of providing public services to Greenland’s roughly 60,000 inhabitants.

According to The Washington Post, sources say staff at the White House budget office are trying to calculate potential revenue from Greenland’s natural resources. Some in the administration argue that the income from extracting valuable commodities—such as rare earth minerals, copper, gold, uranium, and oil—could help offset the expenses of managing the territory.

Trump has kept the issue in public discourse, recently stating that the U.S. will “get” Greenland. Although he added that “there’s a good possibility that we could do it without military force,” he also declined to “take anything off the table.”

Greenlanders have largely rejected the proposal, but U.S. efforts continue, with Vice President JD Vance visiting the island in late March. During a speech at the Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, Vance remarked, “the story of Greenland over the past 20 years when it comes to security is that we’ve underinvested in the infrastructure.”

The trip drew controversy due to changes in its original itinerary. Usha Vance had planned a cultural tour, but protests and mounting political tensions led to adjustments. CNN reports that the White House attributed the change to logistical issues and Greenland’s ongoing process of forming a government—not to any protests.

Denmark’s Foreign Minister criticized the visit and particularly its “tone.” In a published statement, Lars Løkke Rasmussen wrote, “we agree that status quo in the Arctic is not an option. So let’s talk about how we can fix it – together.”
