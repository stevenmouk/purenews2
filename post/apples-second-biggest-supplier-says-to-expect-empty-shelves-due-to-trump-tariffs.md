Up until now, Donald Trump’s trade war with China has mostly been a headache for the markets. But consumers are about to start feeling the real pain, according to Pegatron—a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that’s a major supplier for Apple, Dell, and others. A company executive told Reuters that Trump’s unpredictable, back-and-forth tariff tactics are likely to trigger shortages as summer approaches.

“Within two months, store shelves in the U.S. could start to look like those in developing countries,” Pegatron chairman T.H. Tung warned Reuters. “People will walk into stores and see empty shelves, simply because everyone’s in a holding pattern.”

One major factor behind the looming scarcity is the sky-high 145% tariff the U.S. slapped on Chinese imports—a cost that companies will likely pass along to consumers. But even more disruptive than the tariffs themselves is the overall uncertainty. No one knows what the Trump administration will do next, making long-term planning nearly impossible. “We can’t just overhaul our long-term strategy based on a few months of tariff changes. Manufacturing investments take years to plan,” Tung said.

Apple’s response is a clear example. When Trump unveiled his new “reciprocal” tariff plan earlier this month—including a 34% duty on Chinese imports—Apple rushed to shift stock and adjust its supply chain to dodge the worst effects. The company moved $2 billion worth of iPhones from India to the U.S. before the new tariffs kicked in. Then, as Trump escalated to a staggering 145% tax, Apple began the complex process of moving some of its production from China to India, where the current tariff is a more manageable 10%. Still, even India might see a 26% hike by July if a deal isn’t reached.

Roughly two weeks into the standoff, Trump said he’d exempt products like smartphones and laptops from the tariffs—a brief moment of relief for companies like Apple and its partners. That relief lasted a whole day. Then Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the exemption is only temporary and that new product-specific tariffs could kick in within a couple of months. What will those tariffs be? Will they stick? Who knows. Everyone’s just guessing at this point.

That kind of uncertainty doesn’t work well for global companies with massive supply chains. So rather than gamble, many are waiting it out. In the meantime, expect supplies to dwindle. If you walk into an Apple Store this June, don’t be surprised if the only iPhones you see are bolted to the display tables.
