Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is now available across the White House campus. This marks the latest expansion of Wi-Fi across government facilities since Musk took on an unpaid advisory role in the Trump administration.

It remains unclear when exactly the White House complex was equipped with Starlink following President Trump’s second-term inauguration.

Starlink terminals—rectangular panels that receive internet signals from SpaceX satellites in low-Earth orbit—are typically placed on physical structures. However, rather than installing them directly on-site, the White House has opted to route the Starlink system through an off-site data center, integrating it with existing fiber cables located miles away.

White House officials said the move aimed to enhance internet connectivity on the complex, citing issues such as poor cell service in certain areas and an overburdened Wi-Fi network.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, described the initiative as an effort “to improve Wi-Fi connectivity on the complex.”

However, this installation differs from previous solutions to government internet challenges. Musk, now serving as an unpaid adviser with the title of “special government employee,” oversees Starlink as well as other companies with regulatory matters before the government. His dual role as a key Trump adviser and major donor has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest in recent weeks.

In February, Chris Stanley, a security engineer at both SpaceX and Musk’s social media platform X, visited the Eisenhower Executive Office Building within the White House complex to explore installing Starlink on its rooftop. Stanley also serves as a special government employee working with Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.

As Stanley accessed the rooftop of the building, which sits directly across from a White House entrance, he triggered an alarm that alerted the Secret Service. The sudden incident led to a dramatic response, as a uniformed officer rushed to investigate, according to four individuals familiar with the matter.

A fifth person with knowledge of the event said that while the Secret Service had previously given Stanley permission to examine the roof, they had not coordinated an exact time for his visit.

Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, stated that the administration was “aware of DOGE’s intentions to improve internet access on the campus” and did not classify the alarm-triggering event as a security breach.

Similarly, Anthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesman, confirmed that the agency did not consider the incident a breach.

White House officials explained that Starlink had “donated” the service, a gift that was reviewed and approved by the White House Counsel’s Office ethics lawyer.

However, some former officials expressed uncertainty over how such a donation could be implemented. Clare Martorana, who served as chief information officer at the White House during the Biden administration, noted that government entities typically cannot accept direct technology contributions. She explained that any new system would require approval from the White House’s chief information officer, as well as the General Services Administration’s (GSA) top tech official, to ensure compliance with security protocols.

Stanley collaborated with the White House internet technology office to set up the Starlink system. According to a source familiar with the situation, he was also assigned to work at the Justice Department while advising on this project.

The White House is the latest government site to integrate Starlink.

In recent weeks, Starlink has also been installed at the General Services Administration, which has become a focal point for Musk’s government-efficiency initiatives, according to internal documents and sources.

While multiple federal agencies have contracts with Starlink, the service is generally used in emergencies or remote locations—rather than in Washington, D.C., where traditional internet infrastructure is already robust.

Starlink has earned a reputation as a reliable network. In October, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed Starlink terminals across North Carolina following Hurricane Helene. The service has also played a critical role in Ukraine’s defense against Russia, with SpaceX estimating that its support for Ukraine cost the Defense Department approximately $400 million over a one-year period around 2022.

It remains uncertain whether Starlink will substantially improve wireless internet capacity in government buildings already equipped with fiber connections.

Additionally, questions persist about whether Starlink communications are encrypted. At a minimum, the system establishes a separate network from existing White House servers, allowing on-site personnel to connect without using official government infrastructure.

“It’s extremely rare” for government agencies to replace vetted, secured infrastructure with Starlink or any other external provider, said Jake Williams, vice president of research and development at the cybersecurity firm Hunter Strategy. “I can’t recall another instance of this happening.”

“This creates another potential security risk,” Williams added. “Why introduce that vulnerability?”

One official involved in discussions about Starlink at the White House, who was not authorized to speak publicly, revealed that the Secret Service initially raised concerns about the system being integrated with existing secure wiring used by federal agencies. Those concerns appear to have been resolved by routing Starlink through an external data center.

At the General Services Administration—where NBC News first reported Starlink’s deployment—the service has been added to the list of apps approved for agency-issued mobile devices. That list also includes apps from two other Musk-led companies, X and Tesla, according to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times.

A GSA spokesperson stated that “only apps that meet the agency’s security and privacy standards are permitted.” However, the agency declined to comment on its use of Starlink.

Musk has long been vocal about his dissatisfaction with outdated government technology and has pushed for modernization efforts.

Shortly after President Trump’s second inauguration, Musk criticized WAVES, a digital system used by the Secret Service to approve White House visitors, describing it as cumbersome. Some administration officials agreed with his assessment. Musk then tasked Stanley with improving the system, according to two individuals briefed on the matter.

Secret Service spokesman Guglielmi confirmed that the agency “collaborates closely” with Musk’s team and continues discussions on potential updates. However, he noted that “no formal changes have been made to the White House visitor access system” at this time.
