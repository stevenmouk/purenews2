Williams Formula One driver Carlos Sainz won’t face disciplinary action from the FIA after using profanity during a Thursday press conference in Bahrain, having apologized and expressed regret for the incident.

This comes a year after both Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc were penalized by FIA stewards for swearing in official news conferences, as part of a broader crackdown on inappropriate language under new “misconduct” rules introduced this season.

Sainz had already been fined €10,000 earlier this week for arriving late to the national anthem ahead of last Sunday’s race in Japan. He explained to the stewards that a stomach issue caused the delay.

On Thursday, Sainz discussed the fine during a press conference, saying he was just five seconds late and adding, “I don’t know if I’m going to get another fine for saying this, but s\*\*\* happens.”

The comment technically fell under the FIA’s revised misconduct rules, which outline potential penalties for repeat violations—ranging from fines and points deductions to race bans. However, an FIA spokesperson told The Athletic that Sainz will not face any disciplinary action from the stewards.

Instead, Sainz was spoken to privately on Friday morning by the FIA’s media delegate ahead of the first practice session in Bahrain. During that conversation, he apologized and acknowledged the mistake, assuring officials he would be more cautious in future.

Following this discussion, the FIA decided not to escalate the matter, in contrast to how Verstappen and Leclerc were treated under similar circumstances.

Last year, Verstappen was ordered to perform community service after calling his car “a bit f**\***” in a press conference before the Singapore Grand Prix. He later called the punishment “ridiculous” but followed through by participating in a grassroots racing event in Rwanda before the FIA awards ceremony in December.

At the Mexico City Grand Prix in October, Leclerc also slipped up, using the word “f\*\*\*” while recounting a near-crash. He quickly backtracked, saying, “I don’t want to join Max!” Despite his immediate remorse, he was fined €10,000, with half of that amount suspended for a year.
