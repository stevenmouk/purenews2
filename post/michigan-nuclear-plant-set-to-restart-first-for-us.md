The Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan is moving closer to restarting as President Trump pushes ahead with efforts to revive America's energy sources.

"In carrying out President Trump’s commitment to meeting our rising need for affordable, reliable, and secure electricity, America must tap into all energy forms that strengthen our economy, create jobs, and drive energy independence," said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in the announcement. "Through projects like the Palisades Nuclear Plant, the Energy Department is helping ensure that America's nuclear revival is right around the corner." The DOE did not provide further comment.

Holtec International, the company operating the nuclear plant situated on Lake Michigan in Van Buren County’s Covert Township, secured the third loan installment of $46 million—part of a larger package of up to $1.52 billion from the Department of Energy designated for the plant’s reopening.

"We are excited to bring 800 megawatts of clean, reliable baseload power back to Michigan. The historic restart of Palisades will also return 600 high-skilled jobs to the area. With a targeted restart date of October 2025, we are working hard to ensure the plant is fully prepared to operate for decades to come," a company spokesperson told FOX Business.

This represents a major milestone in the mission to bring Palisades back online later this year—restoring 800 megawatts of safe, dependable baseload energy to the grid and supporting hundreds of good-paying, highly skilled American jobs. It highlights the ongoing importance of U.S. energy security and innovation.

The Palisades Nuclear Plant will become the first commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. to restart. It was originally shut down in May 2022 by its previous owner, Entergy, after operating for 50 years.
