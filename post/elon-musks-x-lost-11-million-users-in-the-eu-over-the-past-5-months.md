A 90-year-old woman from England has reportedly saved around 10,000 animals from neglect and mistreatment through her rescue work.

Barby Keel has spent the past 54 years running the Barby Keel Animal Sanctuary in Sussex, UK—a mission she has no plans of ending as long as she’s physically able.

Her journey began in the 1970s when a soldier stationed in Northern Ireland asked her to care for his dog while he was away. The bond formed so deeply that the dog never left.

Soon, she took in another dog. Then, a local group called the Bexhill Cats Club asked her to care for a few cats. Fast forward five decades, and today Keel is responsible for more than 600 animals, including 160 cats, 8 dogs, 16 pigs, 6 horses, 80 rabbits, and 100 chickens.

“In the beginning, I had about 40 cats,” she told SWNS. “Then I started taking in sheep, goats, pigs, and cows.”

While some of the animals—mostly cats, dogs, and certain rabbits—are rehomed, most remain on the 12-acre sanctuary to live out their lives in peace.

Keel single-handedly managed the sanctuary for 20 years, and now relies on a loyal, diverse group of volunteers to help care for animals rescued from abusive homes, farms, kennels, or abandoned by private owners.

Despite her age, she still tends to the animals every day, leaving the sanctuary only occasionally for groceries or to play darts with a local men’s team. She insists she “never” takes a day off.

Even after surviving cancer three times, she says she has no intention of retiring.

“It’s exhausting sometimes,” she said. “But then a little face pops up or I get a nose nudge, and I remember exactly why I do this. The animals will always come first.”

Her dedication has even led to difficult personal choices, including ending a long-term relationship when her partner gave her an ultimatum: him or the animals.

The Barby Keel Sanctuary runs as a nonprofit, relying entirely on public donations. It recently reopened to visitors and will stay open for free every Sunday through October 2025. Guests can meet the animals, grab a bite at the café, browse the gift shop, or check out the vivarium.

“We’ve got a shop on-site too,” she added. “I use my pension to buy bulk pet food and sell it cheaply so people can afford to feed their pets. The turnout at reopening was incredible.”

“I’m so thankful for my brilliant team of volunteers and all the kind people who support us,” she said. “I’m getting older, and I know I can’t do everything anymore.”

“I’ve stepped back from caring for the big animals, but I still wake up early to feed the cats and check on them all. It’s a lovely life.”
