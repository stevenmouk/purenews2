X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has seen its monthly user base in the European Union drop below pre-Elon Musk levels, according to the company's latest transparency report.

The platform now has 94.8 million monthly active users in the EU — a decrease of about 11 million users since the last report, as first noted by Social Media Today. That’s a sharp decline from the more than 100 million users it had in Europe back in 2022 before Musk bought the company.

This data comes from X’s April 2025 transparency report, part of its legal obligation under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires large platforms to regularly disclose information like content moderation efforts and user statistics. This latest report covers the six-month period from October 2024 to March 2025.

Compared to the previous reporting period, X’s European user base dropped by over 10.5%. France saw the biggest hit, losing more than 2.7 million users. Poland dropped by nearly 2 million, Germany by 1.5 million, and Spain by over 1 million. Even smaller nations like Luxembourg and Lithuania saw steep declines, with around 25% of users leaving the platform.

X’s struggles to retain users aren’t new. Despite Elon Musk’s AI firm xAI purchasing the platform earlier this year for roughly the same amount Musk paid in 2022, X has continued to face falling revenue and user numbers amid ongoing controversies.

There was a brief surge in activity after Donald Trump’s election victory in late 2024, which brought some advertisers — including Apple — back to the platform. But that momentum didn’t last, and experts warned that user attrition would likely continue in 2025.

Though X isn't required to publish user data for regions outside the EU, third-party analysis reported by the Financial Times last year showed steep losses elsewhere too — including a 20% drop in daily active users in the U.S. and a 33% decline in the U.K.

Adding to the challenges, global backlash against Musk’s other major company, Tesla, has also taken a toll. The electric vehicle maker recently reported a 71% drop in profits, driven in part by international protests.
