European regulators are seeking additional details from Google about a covert advertising arrangement with Meta that circumvented the search giant's own policies on treating minors online, raising the likelihood of a formal investigation.

The European Commission is examining several advertising campaigns that promoted Instagram to teenagers via YouTube.

In October, regulators instructed Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to collect and analyze relevant data, presentations, internal messages, and emails tied to these campaigns, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Internal findings from Google’s investigation, code-named “Tangerine Owl,” were submitted to Brussels officials, who are now determining their next steps. The European Commission has not commented on the situation.

The Financial Times (FT) first reported in August that Google employees had helped Meta circumvent restrictions on targeting minors with advertisements.

Although Google prohibits personalized ads for teenagers, the Instagram campaign targeted a user group categorized as “unknown” in its system. Google informed Meta that internal data indicated this group included many users under 18, offering a way to exploit the platform’s safeguards.

Using these insights, Spark Foundry, an agency under French advertising company Publicis, successfully piloted the campaign in Canada. The initiative expanded to the U.S. earlier this year, with plans to roll it out globally and include other Meta platforms like Facebook. However, after the FT report, the project was discontinued.

In response, Google held virtual town halls for its ad staff to reinforce its policies, requiring employees to confirm their understanding of the rules. The company has now prohibited targeting the “unknown” user group exclusively, with the minimum demographic for ad targeting set to ages 18-24.

“Our safeguards to protect teens, such as banning ad personalization, are industry-leading and remain effective,” Google stated. The company has also introduced updated internal training to ensure compliance with its policies.

Google has become increasingly cautious about collaborating with Meta, particularly on campaigns targeting younger users. A scheduled business review with Meta and Spark Foundry was abruptly canceled over the summer as Google investigated the FT’s findings.

Nevertheless, Meta remains a significant advertiser, and the two companies continue to collaborate on campaigns for Instagram and Facebook across various platforms, including YouTube.

Both Google and Meta face mounting scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. In January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized before the U.S. Congress to families of children harmed by exploitation on Meta’s platforms.

Google, meanwhile, has recently lost two antitrust cases related to its app store and search engine. The U.S. Department of Justice is pushing for Alphabet to divest its Chrome browser and share more user data to curb its monopoly in those areas.

In a separate case, a Virginia court recently concluded arguments over Alphabet’s digital advertising practices, and a ruling is expected by year-end.
