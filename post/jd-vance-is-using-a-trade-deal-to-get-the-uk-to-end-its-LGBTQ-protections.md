The Trump administration is reportedly pushing the U.K. to abandon its hate speech protections—laws that make it illegal to incite violence against certain marginalized groups—as part of broader trade negotiations with the United States.

In England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, it's currently a crime to incite hatred based on sexual orientation, while Scotland’s laws also include protections for gender identity. These hate speech laws, aimed at preventing violence against historically targeted communities, are common across developed democracies. However, the U.S. doesn’t have such laws, reflecting its broader interpretation of free speech under the First Amendment.

Now, the Trump administration seems eager to export that American view to the U.K. According to The Independent, an anonymous Washington source claims that Donald Trump and Senator J.D. Vance are pressuring Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer to dismantle Britain’s hate speech laws in exchange for advancing a long-awaited trade agreement.

The source described Vance as someone “obsessed with the decline of Western civilization,” believing that the U.K.’s speech laws are part of that erosion. They added, “This trade deal is a way to pressure the U.K. over free speech. If it doesn’t happen, it reflects badly on Labour. No free speech, no deal. It is as simple as that.”

Vance has been openly critical of European nations, accusing them of stifling free expression. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in February, he minimized the threats posed by Russia and China, instead blaming internal cultural shifts in Europe—pointing fingers at liberals, immigrants, and even climate activist Greta Thunberg. His remarks drew sharp backlash across Europe.

The trade agreement in question has been under discussion for several years, beginning under President Biden. It focuses heavily on emerging sectors like AI and biotechnology. The U.K. has signaled willingness to scrap a tax on digital services, but remains firm in rejecting U.S. meat imports that contain controversial additives. Both countries ultimately aim to eliminate tariffs, though the Trump team’s protectionist leanings have made the U.K. wary.

“I don’t support the U.S.’s recent approach to tariffs,” said Jonathan Reynolds, the U.K.’s Secretary of State for Business and Trade. “We’ve communicated that clearly to our American partners. But we also need to consider global trade imbalances—how some nations don’t follow the same rules we expect in the U.K.”

Despite tensions, Vance remains optimistic about a deal. He suggested that a shared cultural background could help seal the agreement, saying in an interview, “There’s a real cultural affinity. Fundamentally, America is an Anglo country.”
