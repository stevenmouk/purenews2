President Vladimir Putin of Russia agreed yesterday on a call with President Trump to halt strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure for 30 days, as long as Ukraine does the same, the Kremlin said. Putin declined for now to agree to a broader cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine had proposed.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he was open to the truce on attacks on energy infrastructure.

My colleague Paul Sonne, who covers Russia, told me that Putin told Trump “that the ‘key condition’ to resolving the conflict was an end to military and intelligence aid to Ukraine by the West.” Paul added that this path “would essentially make Ukraine perpetually vulnerable to Russia.”

The White House called the pause a first step toward peace, but the outcome seemed to fall well short of what Trump had suggested was possible before the two leaders spoke.

A partial cease-fire would benefit both nations. Ukraine has struggled with Russia’s repeated attacks on its energy grid. The pause would also give Russia a break from Ukraine’s strikes on its oil and gas facilities, jeopardizing a crucial revenue stream.
